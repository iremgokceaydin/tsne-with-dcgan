Check out the main repo https://github.com/karpathy/tsnejs

tSNEJS is an implementation of t-SNE visualization algorithm in Javascript. 

t-SNE is a visualization algorithm that embeds things in 2 or 3 dimensions. If you have some data and you can measure their pairwise differences, t-SNE visualization can help you identify clusters in your data. See example below.

## Online demo
The main project website has a [live example](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/tsnejs/) and more description.

There is also the [t-SNE CSV demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/tsnejs/csvdemo.html) that allows you to simply paste CSV data into a textbox and tSNEJS computes and visualizes the embedding on the fly (no coding needed).
